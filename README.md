This repository contains code associated with an meta-analysis of transcriptomic data across embryogenesis of several vertebrate speices. 
The analyses are aimed at examining whether a developmental hourglass (increased interspecific similarity mid-embryogenesis) is evident in at the level of transcriptomic analysis. 
As of May 2017, microarray data from five species of vertebrates (Mus musculus, Gallus gallus, Xenopus laevis, Xenopus tropicalis, and Danio rerio) are included. Future investications with include RNA-seq data from some overlapping and some unique species. 
Note: this repository and version control practices were a late stage addition... some code is not well vetted, yet.
